title:          RentPath Gives Advertisers a Unified Product Experience with Okta
title_tagline: >
  Okta simplifies the RentPath customer experience and unlocks engineering cycles by providing one central customer authentication service and single sign-on across all customer-facing tools.

  If we're engineering the security layer then we're focusing less time on the thing that differentiates us as a provider of services. The fact that I really haven't had to worry about Okta either from a development or operational standpoint is one of the best testaments that I can give toward its value.

  * RentPath needed a consolidated identity store, authentication, and single sign-on for their suite of disparate advertiser tools.

  * The Okta Identity Platform's Cloud Directory, and LDAP integration agent enabled a seamless transition from a maintenance-intensive homegrown authentication solution.

  * Relying on Okta's highly available service and product roadmap allows the RentPath team to spend more time building features for customers and less time worrying about the identity layer.

## About RentPath
RentPath provides a suite of sites including Rent.com, Rentals.com, RentalHouses.com, Lovely and New Home Guide to help property managers, landlords and home sellers connect with consumers looking for a home.

RentPath sites allow consumers to search for listings by location, find a property manager, get a quote for moving services, browse new homes, and discover home builders by region. Advertisers can manage orders and listings centrally for syndication across all RentPath properties.

## Situation: LDAP - Too much maintenance, yet not enough functionality

RentPath acquires real estate focused sites, and then integrates them together to provide one centralized interface for advertisers who want to manage placements across all of RentPath's inventory. To consolidate advertiser identities and authentication for administration interfaces the RentPath team initially deployed an LDAP server.

"We were maintaining LDAP and providing a little too much support and not enough support at the same time. We were using our own resources, but never enough to get the level of functionality that we were interested in," said Dan Morris, Sr. Director of Architecture and Engineering.

## Solution: Seamless migration to a future-proof authentication service

"Using Okta we were able to allow for a very seamless transition from that legacy system," said Morris.

RentPath decided to migrate authentication and single sign-on to the Okta Identity Platform. Customer identities are now stored centrally in the Okta Universal Directory, and the user lifecycle and authentication is handled entirely via API. This approach allows RentPath full control of the UI. Customers use just one username, one password, and one session to access a series of otherwise siloed services including listings management and support tools.

"We gained a security platform that was growing and evolving with the SaaS model for authentication. We are aligning with the Okta roadmap which has been pretty solid," said Morris.

## Benefits: More time to focus on customers

"If we're engineering the security layer then we're focusing less time on the thing that differentiates us as a provider of services," said Morris. "The fact that I really haven't had to worry about Okta either from a development or operational standpoint is one of the best testaments that I can give toward its value. If you're dealing with a security system, the highest praise you can give it is that you don't have any concerns."
