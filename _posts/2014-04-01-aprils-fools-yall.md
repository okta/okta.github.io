Spaghetti trees: The BBC television programme Panorama ran a hoax in 1957, showing Swiss harvesting spaghetti from trees. They had claimed that the despised pest, the spaghetti weevil, had been eradicated. A large number of people contacted the BBC wanting to know how to cultivate their own spaghetti trees. It was, in fact, filmed in St Albans.[1] The editor of Panorama at the time Michael Peacock gave the go-ahead to the idea which was pitched by freelance camera operator Charles de Jaeger. Michael Peacock told the BBC in 2014 how he gave Charles de Jaeger a budget of Â£100 and sent him off. Mr Peacock said the respected Panorama anchorman Richard Dimbleby knew they were using his authority to make the joke work. Mr Peacock said Mr Dimbleby loved the idea and went at it with relish. [2] Decades later CNN called this broadcast "the biggest hoax that any reputable news establishment ever pulled".[3]

In 1962, the Swedish national television broadcast a 5-minute special[4] on how one could get color TV by placing a nylon stocking in front of the TV. A rather in-depth description on the physics behind the phenomenon was included. Thousands of people tried it.

Smell-o-vision: In 1965, the BBC purported to conduct a trial of a new technology allowing the transmission of odour over the airwaves to all viewers. Many viewers reportedly contacted the BBC to report the trial's success.[5] In 2007, the BBC website repeated an online version of the hoax.[6] As did Google in 2013, in tribute.

In 2008, the BBC reported on a newly discovered colony of flying penguins. An elaborate video segment was even produced, featuring Terry Jones walking with the penguins in Antarctica, and following their flight to the Amazon rainforest.[7]
