## Overview 

Administrators can generate tokens to access the API via the Security > API section of the admin application. Note, tokens generated by this mechanism will have the permissions of the user who generated them. A user must be enrolled in MFA to create an API token.

## Token Expiration

Okta uses a bearer token for API authentication with a sliding scale expiration.  Tokens are valid for 30 days and automatically refresh with each API call.  Tokens that are not used for 30 days will expire.  The token lifetime is currently fixed and cannot be changed for your organization. 

## Token Deactivation

If a user account is deactivated in Okta, the API Token is deprovisioned at the same time.
