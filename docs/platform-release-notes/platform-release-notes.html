<h2 id="release-201710">Release 2017.10</h2>

<h3 id="advance-notice-api-rate-limit-improvements">Advance Notice: API Rate Limit Improvements</h3>

<p>We are making org-wide rate limits more granular, and treating authenticated end-user interactions
separately. More granular rate limits will further lessen the likelihood of calls to one URI impacting
another. Treating authenticated end-user interactions separately will lessen the chances of one user’s
impacting another. We’re also providing a transition period so you can see what these changes will
look like in your Okta system log before enforcing them:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Starting in early April, 2017, we’ll provide system log alerts to let you know that you
would have exceeded any of these new API rate limits.</li>
  <li>Starting in mid-April, 2017, we’ll treat authenticated end-user interactions on a per-user basis.
Interactions like SSO after login won’t apply to your org-wide API rate limits.</li>
  <li>Early in May, 2017, we will enforce the new, more granular rate limits. At that
point, the warnings in the System Log will change to error notifications.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, as each change is released, we’ll announce the change here.</p>
