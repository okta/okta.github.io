	    <p>This post describes our odyssey with ActiveMQ, an open-source version of the Java Messaging Service (JMS) API. We use ActiveMQ as the message broker among our app servers.</p>

<p>First, a word of thanks. To overcome the challenges we faced with ActiveMQ, we are greatly indebted to a very thorough description of an <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8054446">OpenJDK bug</a>, as well as some other <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/standard/classlib/trunk/modules/concurrent/src/main/java/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentLinkedQueue.java">online resources</a>. If you’re having problems with ActiveMQ, read on. Maybe our story can help you.</p>

<h2 id="growing-pains">Growing Pains</h2>

<p>Our problems with ActiveMQ date all the way back to 2012. They centered around high memory and CPU usage, message timeout errors, and message queue delays.</p>

<p>Let’s pick up the action in the spring 2014. At that time we were battling a new wave of timeout storms and message queue delays caused by our mixed ActiveMQ configuration (broker <strong>5.4.1</strong>, client <strong>5.7</strong>) and increasing traffic on our site.</p>

<p>Of course we welcomed the growth in traffic as a byproduct of our growing business. And although we did plan to address our mixed ActiveMQ configuration, we decided to delay doing so at that time, opting instead to tune the configuration. So we increased the maximum session size from 500 to 2000, and the page size from 200 to 2000 messages. Increasing the page size served to minimize “hung queue” scenarios — a side effect of using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19798-01/821-1841/bncer/index.html">message selectors</a>.</p>

<h2 id="another-inflection-point">Another Inflection Point</h2>

<p>Business and site traffic continued to grow, contributing to another inflection point in the fall of 2014. Timeout storms, CPU spikes, and memory issues returned. It was clear that we could no longer put off upgrading to a newer version of ActiveMQ.</p>

<p>We decided to skip versions 5.7 and 5.8 in favor of 5.10, mainly because 5.7 was considered unstable, and 5.10 provided improved failover performance.</p>

<p>Would this upgrade finally deliver the stability that had eluded us for so long?</p>

<h2 id="when-upgrades-bite-back">When Upgrades Bite Back</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, no. Within 24 hours, memory usage soared, CPUs spiked, and instability returned. Note the dramatic CPU spikes in the following screenshot.</p>

<p><img style="width:50%" src="/assets/img/2015-05-08-productionalizing-active-mq-cpu-graph-1.png" alt="Active MQ CPU" /></p>

<p>To prevent these issues from impacting customers, we were forced to restart brokers, which is always an option of
last resort. Restarting brokers is a delicate operation, which can entail a less-than-smooth failover,
risking message loss.</p>

<p>We immediately increased memory, but within a day or two we ran out of memory again.</p>

<h2 id="searching-for-the-root-cause">Searching for the Root Cause</h2>

<p>An online search turned up an <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8054446">OpenJDK bug</a> that identified an out of memory issue in the
<em>ConcurrentLinkedQueue</em>, which is a class in the <strong>java.util.concurrent</strong> package included in <strong>JVM version 1.6</strong>.
When working properly, <em>ConcurrentLinkedQueue</em> allows elements to be added and removed from the queue in a
thread-safe manner.</p>

<p>The bug caused a null object to be created whenever an element at the end of the queue was added and
then deleted. This behavior is particularly unfavorable to the way we use queuing. We call ActiveMQ
to create and destroy objects in the queue very quickly, tens of millions of times a day, as users
and agents connect to Okta. As a result, null objects rapidly fill up the queue, memory usage soars,
and CPUs spike.</p>

<h2 id="conference-call">Conference Call</h2>

<p>With the site at risk of impacting customer authentication, several key engineers, including Hector
Aguilar, Okta’s CTO and SVP of Engineering, met on a Saturday afternoon conference call. Discussion was intense, and our options were few and unappealing:
(a) revert all the way back to broker version 5.4.1, or (b) upgrade to broker version 5.11, which
was still unreleased and might introduce new problems.</p>

<p>As team members recall, Hector said very little during the first half of the meeting.</p>

<p>A bug in the JVM surprised Hector, as critical JVM bugs are relatively rare. Fortunately, the
OpenJDK bug we’d found included a very thorough description of the problem, as well as sample code
to reproduce it.</p>

<p>Initially motivated by curiosity, Hector analyzed the code and the bug description. He saw where the
problem was, and then checked online to see if it had been fixed in newer JDK versions. He noticed that
several things were changing in the class, and that others had attempted to resolve the bug in
different ways, but none that would solve our particular problem. Hector developed a very simple fix
of his own, trying to remain consistent with the work of others. He then verified his fix using the
provided sample code.</p>

<p>The JVM has a mechanism called <em>endorsed libraries</em> that allows developers to override an existing
class with a new class, effectively patching the JVM. Hector used this mechanism, packaged his fix
into a jar file, tried it against ActiveMQ, and found that it worked.</p>

<p>The mood and direction of the meeting shifted dramatically when Hector said, <em>“Guys, I have a wild
idea. What if we patch the JVM?”</em> As none of us had ever patched a JVM before, this seemed like a novel approach, even a long
shot.</p>

<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>

<p>Hector sent his JVM patch and sample code to the team and walked us through it. First, he explained
why the other attempted fixes wouldn’t solve our particular problem. He then demonstrated how his override effectively patched the original (faulty) removal method. Members of the
team volunteered to test the override at scale with our simulated environments. Within a few hours,
we were fairly sure that Hector’s fix would work.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-the-patch">Deploying the Patch</h2>

<p>We deployed the patch and restarted brokers. It was a success! ActiveMQ no longer ran out of memory
and the CPU spikes ceased.</p>

<p><img style="width:50%" src="/assets/img/2015-05-08-productionalizing-active-mq-cpu-graph-2.png" alt="Active MQ CPU" /></p>

<p>Some minor memory leaks remained, but these were eliminated by upgrading to <strong>java-1.7.0</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="stable-and-looking-at-other-solutions">Stable, and looking at other solutions</h2>

<p>Patching the <em>ConcurrentLinkedQueue</em> with ActiveMQ v5.10 and upgrading to java-1.7.0 provided
acceptable stability and faster failover performance. While this is a significant improvement over
where we were last fall, our goal is <strong>zero failover time</strong>, which ActiveMQ cannot deliver. So, we’re exploring other messaging solutions.</p>

<p>In telling our story, we couldn’t resist tooting our own horn a bit. How many CTOs actually get
their hands dirty tackling product issues? Our CTO doesn’t code very often, but when
he does, he patches the JVM.</p>
