It would be pretty easy to block this word alone, but doing so would also block the proper use of the word referring to donkeys. Then you need to think about both variations of the word and where those letters happen to come together: 'badass,' 'hard-ass,' 'amass,' 'bagasse', the first two are questionable while the second two are fine. Even if you block all of these and the thousands of other words that contain these three letters, there are still variations that would make it past: '4ss', 'as.s,' 'azz,' '@ss,' 'ƒÅss,' or '\\\\41\\\\73\\\\73' (escaped characters).
