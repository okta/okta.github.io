	<p><em>Effective Date: April 4, 2017</em></p>
	<h2 class="large">Introduction</h2>
	<p>Okta, Inc. ("Us," "We," "Our," "Okta," or the "Company") is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Statement describes Okta's Web site privacy practices.</p>

	<p>If you have questions or complaints regarding Okta’s Privacy Statement or practices, please contact Okta at <a href="mailto:info@okta.com">info@okta.com</a>.</p>

	<p>Okta complies with the U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from Switzerland.</p>

	<h2>Web Sites Covered</h2>

	<p>Okta has established this Privacy Policy to help you to understand how Okta collects and uses personal information. This Privacy Policy covers the information practices of Web sites that link to this Privacy Policy, including, but not limited to <a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank">https://www.okta.com</a>.</p>

	<p>Okta's Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. Okta is not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other Web sites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.</p>

	<h2>Information Collected by Okta</h2>

	<p>Okta is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers’ data and user information. Okta has established a privacy policy to help users understand how Okta collects and uses personal information within the Okta website.</p>

	<p>Okta does not collect email addresses from the Okta production service for marketing use. Okta does collect information from individuals (“Visitors”) who visit the Okta Website. This information is collected in accordance with this privacy policy, from sources that include but not limited to content syndication, website registration forms, webinar registration forms and conferences.</p>

	<p><strong>Personal Information You Provided to Us.</strong> Okta collects information from Visitors to the Okta website. Okta receives and stores any information entered when expressing an interest in obtaining more information about the Okta SSO &amp; IAM Service or registering to use the Service. When expressing an interest in obtaining information about the Services or registering to use the Services on Okta’s website, Okta may require you to provide personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, email address, and any other information necessary for us to provide Visitors with access to the various aspects of the Services (collectively, “Personal Information”). The Personal Information you provided is used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the website, customizing the content, and communicating with the Visitors about Okta's Services, including specials and new features. </p>

	<p><strong>Personal Information Collected Automatically.</strong> As Visitors navigate or interact with Okta's website, Okta may also automatically collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies, Web beacons, tags, and scripts. These information gathering maybe used by our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics and service providers as described below.  We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. </p>

	<ol class="default">
		<li><strong>Cookies</strong>
			<p>Okta uses cookies to make interactions with the website easy and meaningful. When a Visitor interacts with the website, Okta's servers send a cookie to the Visitor’s computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify the Visitor. They merely recognize the visitor’s Web browser. Unless the Customer chooses to identify themselves to Okta, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, Okta has no way to associate this cookie data with the Visitor’s Personal Information.  </p>

			<p>For the website, Okta uses cookies that are session-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from the Visitor’s computer upon closing their browser software or turning off their computer. </p>
			<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off cookies, which will prevent their browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of the browser software) allowing the Visitor to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. </p>

			<p>Okta's website connects Visitors to third party services, with whom Okta partners with to provide the content. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by Okta’s privacy statement. Okta does not have access or control over these cookies. Okta’s partners use session ID cookies to manage a user's connection to the partner's service. </p>

			<p>For more information on the list of cookies that Okta uses, please <a href="https://www.okta.com/privacy-policy/">click here</a>. </p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Web Beacons </strong>
			<p>Okta uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Visitors’ usage of the website, interaction with emails from Okta, and to operate and improve the website. Web beacons are invisible electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on a Visitors computer, such as (1) cookies, (2) the time a particular website is viewed to the Web beacon, or (3) a description of a website tied to the Web beacon. </p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>IP Addresses and Browser Information </strong>
			<p>When a Visitor interacts with the website, Okta collects their Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser information and operating system to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Okta uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Visitors navigate the website. </p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Other Third Party Tracking </strong>
			<p>Okta engages third parties, which use web beacons, images, and scripts, to help better manage content on Okta’s website. Okta does not provide Personal Information to the third parties but may tie the information gathered from third party tracking to our Visitors’ personal information for marketing purposes.</p>

		</li>
		<li><strong>Log Files</strong>
			<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, operating system, and/or date/time stamp. </p>
			<p>We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. </p>

		</li>
		<li><strong>Behavioral Targeting/ Re- Targeting</strong>
			<p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.

If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">clicking here</a> (or if located in the European Union <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">click here</a>). </p>

			<p>Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Local Storage Objects (LSOs)</strong>
			<p>Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.</p>
