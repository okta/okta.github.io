Building a microservices architecture with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud can allow your team to scale and develop software faster. It can provide resiliency and elasticity to your architecture that allows it to fail gracefully and scale infinitely. All this is great, but you really need continuous deployment and excellent security to ensure your system stays up-to-date, healthy, and safe for years to come.

Did you know that Spring Security and its OAuth support provide everything you need to lock down your API gateway, as well as your backend servers? You can set it up to automatically propogate your access tokens from one app to the other, ensuring that everything stays secure and encrypted along the way.

This tutorial shows you how to use Spring Security with OAuth and Okta to lock down your microservices architecture. You might remember a similar post I wrote back in August: [Secure a Spring Microservices Architecture with Spring Security, JWTs, Juiser, and Okta](/blog/2017/08/08/secure-spring-microservices). The difference in this post is you won't be using any Okta SDKs, Spring Security OAuth has everything you need!

This tutorial shows you how to add security to a previous tutorial I wrote, [Build a Microservices Architecture for Microbrews with Spring Boot](/blog/2017/06/15/build-microservices-architecture-spring-boot). A basic microservices architecture with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud looks like the graphic below.

Once you've completed this tutorial, you'll have Spring Security locking things down, and Okta providing authorization with OAuth. Your Edge Service (a.k.a., API Gateway) will have a Feign client that passes along your access token, and Hystrix that handles graceful failover.

To begin, youâ€™ll need to clone the aforementioned articleâ€™s completed project.

```
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-microservices-example.git
