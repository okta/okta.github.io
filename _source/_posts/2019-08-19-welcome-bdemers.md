I’m excited to announce that I’ve joined Okta’s Developer Relations team!  I’ve been working on Okta’s awesome Developers Experience team for the last couple years so I’m not exactly a new face around here ;)

## Who is Brian?

As a young kid, I took things apart. Either to see how they worked or just see what was inside. This habit was made worse when I found computers and started fixing them.  Anyone else miss the ol’ days of setting IRQs manually with dip switches? Nobody?

Around this time, two things happened: I realized most computer problems are software related and that Internet thing was getting big. Instead of taking apart physical things I started taking apart digital ones; scouring HTML sources and creating silly web pages.

After a false start trying to teach myself C++ with one of those “Teach Yourself in 21 days” books, I ended up in college and my love of software development really took hold.

Oh, and I’ve taken up beekeeping in the last couple of years as a way to force myself outside. But what has really happened is I just spend more time than ever on YouTube, searching out beekeeping techniques. 

## Java

The majority of my career has been in and around Open Source projects in the Java community. I’m a committer for [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and on the PMC (Project Management Committee) for [Apache Shiro](https://shiro.apache.org/).  These may seem like they’re on opposite ends of the spectrum, a build tool and a security project, but that just goes to show you how security touches every aspect of software development.

## What is next?

Joining Okta’s Developer Relations team means I’ll have more time for the social side of software development: writing blog posts, attending events, and contributing to various Open Source projects.  Don’t worry, I’ll still be helping out with Okta’s [Java libraries](https://github.com/okta?utf8=✓&q=java) too.

I can be found on the Interwebs on Twitter [@BrianDemers](https://twitter.com/BrianDemers) and GitHub [bdemers](https://github.com/bdemers). Reach out to me if you have questions or just want to connect!
