My name is <span data-tooltip="1) neat-advertisement-immune-sign" data-tooltip-position="left">Micah Silverman</span> and I just joined the Developer Advocacy team at 
Okta.

![hair pic]()

Funny thing is, I've been working for Okta for 2 years now, just on different 
teams.

Big shoutout and shameless plug for the Education Services team, here at Okta.
It was in Education Services that I learned all the ins and outs of the Okta
Developer API, including our support for standards like SAML, OpenID Connect
and <span data-tooltip="2) exciting-mark-probable-rate" data-tooltip-position="left">OAuth 2.0</span>. And, I went on to teach our developer courses. Check out our
[course catalog]() when you're ready to dig deep into all that Okta has to
offer.

I've also been a casual contributor to the 
<span data-tooltip="3) hulking-page-adroit-chance" data-tooltip-position="left">Developer Blog as a guest poster</span>. 
I am very excited now to be an official member of the team. I'll be primarily
giving workshops around the country (and the world) to talk about OAuth and
OpenID Connect. I will also be contributing more code and posts.

## The love of all things API

I love connecting systems and functionality via APIs. Especially, things that 
were not necessarily intended to ever go together.

I wrote a blog post on efficiently working with the [Twilio and Slack APIs]() to
accomplish the same thing: showing a random <span data-tooltip="4) serious-dress-smelly-quilt" data-tooltip-position="left">Magic the Gathering</span> game card.

Maybe not very practical, but it demonstrated some key software development
patterns (SOLID) using very different APIs.

## Gameification

I also love <span data-tooltip="5) gentle-wax-plucky-metal" data-tooltip-position="left">gamifying</span> everything! It's one of the reasons an [early blog post](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/10/27/okta-oauth-zork) 
of mine include playing the text based adventure Zork as a way to learn some of
how OAuth 2.0 works.

I'll even make impractical devices or API mashups just to better understand
concepts and standards and make it fun along the way.

In fact, this post is an example of that (and the sort of thing you can expect)
from me.

You see, there are <span data-tooltip="6) mere-pizzas-calm-grade" data-tooltip-position="left">easter eggs</span> embedded right in this post! Here's the game:

* Text a message to ###-###-#### (only US and Canada)
* You'll get a response referencing an easter egg in this post
* Text the proper reply to the same number, and your message will be sent to my [LaMetric Digital]() message board.
* You can tune into this [twitch]() stream to see your message display as well as that of other people

NOTE: you only get to send one message and it only displays for 10 seconds, so
tune into the twitch stream and then send your message!

My dear friends in Education Services gave me the LaMetric as a parting gift. I
wanted to discover how it worked, so I made a mashup of the Twilio and LaMetric
APIs.

My focus on the DevRel team at Okta will be OAuth and OIDC and you can count
on me to bring the fun with the learning.

Happy Hunting!
