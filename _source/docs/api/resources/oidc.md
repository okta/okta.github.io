# Overview

The OpenID Connect API endpoints enable clients to use [OIDC workflows](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) with Okta.

With OpenID Connect and Okta, a client can use Okta as a broker when the user authenticates against identity providers like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Microsoft,
and the client returns an Okta session.

> This API is currently in **Early Access** status.  It has been tested as thoroughly as a Generally Available feature. Contact Support to enable this feature.

## ID Token

OpenID Connect introduces an [ID Token](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) 
which is a [JSON web token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) that contains information about an authentication event 
as well as claims about the authenticated user.

ID Tokens should always be [validated](#validating-id-tokens) by the client to ensure their integrity.

The ID Token (`id_token`) consists of three period-separated, base64URL-encoded JSON segments: [a header](#header), [the payload](#payload), and [the signature](#signature).

###Signature

This is the digital signature that Okta signs, using the public key identified by the `kid` property in the header section.

###ID Token Claims

The header and payload sections contain claims.

####Claims in the header section

Claims in the header are always returned.

>The client can also optionally request an Access Token along with the ID Token. In this case, in order to keep the size of the ID Token small, the ID Token body does not contain all the scope dependent claims. 
Instead, the ID token contains the `name` and `preferred_username` claims if the `profile` scope was requested and `email` claim if the `email` scope was requested.

>The full set of claims for the requested scopes is available via the [/oauth2/v1/userinfo](#get-user-information) endpoint. Call this endpoint using the Access Token.

##Endpoints

Both the Access Token and the ID Token are acquired via [OAuth 2.0](oauth2.html) endpoints.

###Get User Information
{:.api .api-operation}

<span class="api-uri-template api-uri-get"><span class="api-label">GET, POST</span> /oauth2/v1/userinfo</span>

You must include the `access_token` returned from the [/oauth2/v1/authorize](oauth2.html#authentication-request) endpoint as an authorization header parameter.

This endpoint complies with the [OIDC userinfo spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo).

####Request Example
{:.api .api-request .api-request-example}

~~~sh
curl -v -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
"https://${org}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo"
~~~

####Response Parameters
{:.api .api-response .api-response-example}

Returns a JSON document with information requested in the scopes list of the token.

####Response Example (Success)
{:.api .api-response .api-response-example}
~~~json
{
  "sub": "00uid4BxXw6I6TV4m0g3",
  "name" :"John Doe",
  "nickname":"Jimmy",
  "given_name":"John",
  "middle_name":"James",
  "family_name":"Doe",
  "profile":"http://profile.wordpress.com/john.doe",
  "zoneinfo":"America/Los_Angeles",

  "phone_number":"+1 (425) 555-1212"
}
~~~

The claims in the response are identical to those returned for the requested scopes in the `id_token` JWT, except for the sub-claim which is always present. 
See [Scope-Dependent Claims](#scope-dependent-claims) for more information about individual claims.

####Response Example (Error)

~~~http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorizedâ€‹
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-storeâ€‹
Pragma: no-cacheâ€‹
Expires: 0â€‹

~~~

####Response Example (Error)

###Validating ID Tokens

You can pass ID Tokens around different components of your app, and these components can use it as a lightweight authentication mechanism identifying the app and the user.
But before you can use the information in the ID Token or rely on it as an assertion that the user has authenticated, you must validate it to prove its integrity.

ID Tokens are sensitive and can be misused if intercepted. Transmit them only over HTTPS
and only via POST data or within request headers. If you store them on your server, you must store them securely.

Clients MUST validate the ID Token in the Token Response in the following manner:

1. Verify that the `iss` (issuer) claim in the ID Token exactly matches the issuer identifier for your Okta org (which is typically obtained during [Discovery](#openid-discovery-document)). 
2. Verify that the `aud` (audience) claim contains the `client_id` of your app.
3. Verify the signature of the ID Token according to [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) using the algorithm specified in the JWT `alg` header parameter. Use the public keys provided by Okta via the [Discovery Document](#openid-discovery-document).
4. Verify that the expiry time (from the `exp` claim) has not already passed.
5. A `nonce` claim must be present and its value checked to verify that it is the same value as the one that was sent in the Authentication Request. The client should check the nonce value for replay attacks.
6. The client should check the `auth_time` claim value and request re-authentication using the `prompt=login` parameter if it determines too much time has elapsed since the last end-user authentication.

Step 3 involves downloading the public JWKS from Okta (specified by the `jwks_uri` attribute in the [discovery document](#opendid-discovery-document)). The result of this call is a [JSON Web Key](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) set.

Each public key is identified by a `kid` attribute, which corresponds with the `kid` claim in the [ID Token header](#claims-in-the-header-section).

The ID Token and the access token are signed by an RSA private key. Okta publishes the corresponding public key and adds a public-key identifier `kid` in the ID Token header. To minimize the effects of key rotation, your application should check the `kid`, and if it has changed, check the `jwks_uri` value in the [well-known configuration](#openid-connect-metadata) for a new public key and `kid`. 

All apps must roll over keys for adequate security. Please note the following:

* For security purposes, Okta automatically rotates keys used to sign the token.
* The current key rotation schedule is at least twice a year. This schedule can change without notice.
* In case of an emergency, Okta can rotate keys as needed.
* Okta always publishes keys to the JWKS.
* If your app follows the best practice to always resolve the `kid`, key rotations will not cause problems.
* If you download the key and store it locally, **you are responsible for updates**.

>Keys used to sign tokens automatically rotate and should always be resolved dynamically against the published JWKS. Your app might break if you hardcode public keys in your applications! Be sure to include key rollover in your implementation.

>Okta strongly recommends retrieving keys dynamically with the JWKS published in the discovery document. It is safe to cache or persist downloaded keys for performance, but if your application is pinned to a signing key, you must check the keys as Okta automatically rotates signing keys.

There are standard open-source libraries available for every major language to perform [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) signature validation.
