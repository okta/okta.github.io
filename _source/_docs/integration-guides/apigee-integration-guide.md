# Apigee Integration Guide

This guide describes the process of integrating Oktaâ€™s API Access Management with Apigee. Okta serves as an authorization server and mints access tokens for users. Amazon API Gateway proxies an API and checks for a valid token with appropriate scopes before allowing access to a resource.

## Example Integration

A [complete integration example](https://okta-api-am.herokuapp.com/apigee) on Heroku illustrates authentication and shows decoded access tokens for two different users.

## Prerequisites

To build your own integration you need:

* An API. You can complete this integration without an actual target API, but the integration assumes that you are using Apigee to proxy the endpoints: `/planets` and `/moons`, which are available in the public Okta solar system API:
    * [https://okta-solar-system.herokuapp.com/planets](https://okta-solar-system.herokuapp.com/planets)
    * [https://okta-solar-system.herokuapp.com/moons](https://okta-solar-system.herokuapp.com/moons)

* An Okta org with API Access Management enabled. ([Sign up for an Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/))
* An [Apigee instance](https://login.apigee.com/sign__up)
* Web server and an application. Your application needs at least a simple page to accept access tokens coming back from Okta: `localhost` is sufficient.

## Set Up Your Scenario

The scenario:

* Users try to access a resource on a target resource server. We are going to set it up so that users must have a scope of `http://myapp.com/scp/silver` to access the endpoint `/planets` on the target server.
* Apigee bounces users who don't have a valid access token, including the required scope.

### Set Up an Okta Org

Set up your Okta groups and authorization server using [these instructions](/docs/integration-guides/setting-up-okta-for-integration-examples).

### Set Up an Apigee Instance

Use the [Apigee instructions](https://github.com/tom-smith-okta/okta-apigee) to download the proxy server definition and deploy it to your Apigee instance.
