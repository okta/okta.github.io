# Amazon API Gateway Integration Guide

This guide describes the process of integrating Oktaâ€™s API Access Management with Amazon API Gateway. Okta serves as an authorization server and mints access tokens for users. Amazon API Gateway proxies an API and checks for a valid token with appropriate scopes before allowing access to a resource.

## Example Integration

A [complete integration example](https://okta-api-am.herokuapp.com/aws) on Heroku illustrates authentication and shows decoded access tokens for two different users.

## Prerequisites

To build your own integration you need:

* An Okta org with API Access Management enabled. ([Sign up for an Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/))
* An Amazon Web Services account. ([Sign up for an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start))
* Web server and an application. Your application needs at least a simple page to accept access tokens coming back from Okta: `localhost` is sufficient.

## Set Up For Example Integration

For this example integration, assume:

* Users try to access a resource on a target resource server. We are going to set it up so that users must have a scope of `http://myapp.com/scp/silver` to access the endpoint `/planets` on the target server.
* Amazon API Gateway bounces users who don't have a valid access token, including the required scope.

### Set Up an Okta Org

Set up your Okta groups and authorization server using [these instructions](/docs/integration-guides/setting-up-okta-for-integration-examples).

### Set Up an Amazon API Gateway

If you don't already have an API set up in Amazon API Gateway, use the [Amazon Getting Started with API Gateway Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html) to set up a pet store API.

Then set up a lambda authorizer function - which parses Okta jwts - and add it to your API Gateway, using [these instructions](https://github.com/mcguinness/node-lambda-oauth2-jwt-authorizer).
