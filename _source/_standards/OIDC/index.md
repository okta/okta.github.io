# OpenID Connect and Okta

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
In technical terms, OpenID Connect specifies a RESTful HTTP API, using JSON as a data format.

OpenID Connect allows a range of clients, including Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users.
The [specification suite](http://openid.net/connect/) is extensible, supporting optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session management.

Okta is [certified for OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/certification/).
