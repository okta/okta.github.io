# OAuth 2.0 and Okta

OAuth 2.0 is the next evolution of the OAuth protocol and is not backwards compatible with OAuth 1.0. 
OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.
 
The specification and associated RFCs are developed by [the IETF OAuth WG](https://tools.ietf.org/wg/oauth/).
[The main framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [Bearer Token Usage](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) were published in 2012. 
Other documents are still being worked on within the OAuth working group.
