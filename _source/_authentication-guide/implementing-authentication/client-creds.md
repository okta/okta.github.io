# Implementing the Client Credentials Flow

The Client Credentials flow is recommended for use in machine-to-machine authentication. Your application will need to securely store it's Client ID and Secret and pass those to Okta in exchange for an access token. At a high-level, the flow only has two steps:

- Your application passes its client credentials to your Okta authorization server
- If the credentials are accurate, Okta responds with an access token

### 1. Setting up your Application

1. From the Applications page, choose **Add Application**
2. You will now be on the Create New Application page. From here, select **Service**
3. Fill-in the Application Name, then click **Done**.

### 2. Creating Custom Scopes

The Client Credentials flow never has a user context, so you can't request OpenID scopes. Instead, you must create a custom scope. For more information on creating custom scopes, see [our OAuth 2.0 overview](/authentication-guide/auth-overview/#client-credentials-flow).

### 3. Using the Client Credentials Flow

Your Client Application will need to have its Client ID and Secret stored in a secure manner. These are then passed via Basic Auth in the request to your Okta Authorization Server's `/token` endpoint:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://dev-686102.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/v1/token \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --header 'authorization: Basic MG9hY...' \
  --header 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data 'grant_type=client_credentials&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&scope=customScope'
```

> NOTE: The Client ID and Secret arenâ€™t included in the POST body, but rather are placed in the HTTP Authorization header following the rules of HTTP Basic Auth.

Note the parameters that are being passed:

- `grant_type` is `client_credentials`, indicating that we are using the Client Credentials grant type.
- `redirectUri` must match one of the "Login redirect URIs" you specified when you were creating your application in Okta.
- `scope` must be at least one custom scope that you have created. For more information about this, see the [Custom Authorization Server chapter](/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/set-up-authz-server.html#create-scopes-optional).

If the credentials are valid, the application will receive back an access token:

```
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbG[...]1LQ",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "scope": "customScope"
}
```

### 3. Next Steps

When your application sends a request with an access_token, the resource server will need to validate it. For more on this, see [Validating Access Tokens](/authentication-guide/tokens/validating-access-tokens).
