Apps are the representation of an application or directory source or target in Okta.  Specific application attributes are defined on an app by app basis. Through the Apps endpoint you gain additional insight into who a user is across the ecosystem. We also see the meaning behind a group and the roles and entitlements it describes.

#### Best Practices Apps

<div style="border: 1px solid #626b6d; background-color: #ddf8ff; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 15px">

In addition to the [Common Guidance] offered above, the Apps API carries these unique guidelines.

The page size (`limit` _parameter_) should be a configurable value with a range between 10 and 100. The default value should be 20.

The interval of ongoing polling should be configurable. Frequent polling of apps can provide little value on its own. While not resource intensive it should be understood that application additions and changes are infrequent operations, as such an interval minimum of daily should be acceptable.

Further guidance about resources inside of the Apps endpoint are discussed in the [AppUsers](#appUsers) and [AppGroups](#appGroups) sections below.

#### Apps Data

The application data model is described in [detail here](../../docs/api/resources/apps.html#application-properties)

Here we will draw attention to a few App attributes and their meaning in the context of a security analytics integration:

+ `features`
  + [This collection](../../docs/api/resources/apps.html#features) will describe the provisioning capabilities that are in effect for the application
+ `signOnMode`
  + [This object](../../docs/api/resources/apps.html#signon-modes) will describe what method of authentication (if any) is in place for the application
+ `credentials.scheme`
  + For applications where Okta is vaulting credentials for application, using [this attribute](../../docs/api/resources/apps.html#authentication-schemes) describes how they are managed

##### Apps - Retrieve active applications

using a filter on the status attribute to retrieve a [list the active Applications](../../docs/api/resources/apps.html#list-applications)

Request
{:.api .api-request .api-request-example}

```sh
GET {base_url}/api/v1/apps?filter=status eq "ACTIVE"
```

Response
{:.api .api-response .api-response-example}

```json
