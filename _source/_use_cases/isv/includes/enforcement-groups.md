Groups are a first-class citizen in the Okta environment. They serve purposes including but not limited to:

+ Application Assignment
+ Application Role
+ Policy Assignment

With that in mind, the simple manipulation of group membership can have far reaching effects to strengthen your customerâ€™s security posture.\\
For example

+ Adding a user to a group could enforce a restrictive authentication policy with short session lifetimes that always require MFA policy
+ Removing a user from a group could un-assign a sensitive application or remove a permissive role in a downstream application

> As previously mentioned, the `{group_id}` referenced below is an opaque Okta ID and may need to be discovered or configured in some way.\\
Refer to the [Groups](./security-analytics.html#groups) section in our analytics guide for ideas related to working with groups.
