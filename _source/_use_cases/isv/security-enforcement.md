## Write back to enforce policy in Okta

Building from the foundation laid in our [Security Analytics] guide

To resolve an incident or mitigate a perceived threat, an external system may want to affect a userâ€™s state, modify authentication policies or reduce application availability. This document will describe how and when a system might take these actions.

### Information About Examples

<div style="border: 1px solid #626b6d; background-color: #ddf8ff; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 15px">

#### Simplified Examples

For readability simplified versions of the API transactions will be illustrated below. We use the following modifications:

+ Repetitive details like content-type and authorization headers will be excluded
+ Request and response objects will be truncated to focus on the most relevant information
  + Truncated sections will be denoted by an ellipsis ("...")
+ Replacement values will be noted in italicized braces _{}_
+ Examples:
  + `{base_url}` = Base URL of the Okta org (e.g. _`https://acme.okta.com`_ )
  + `{user_id}` = Opaque and Immutable Okta ID for a user (e.g. _`00u1ae58uup0y5Qkg1d8`_)
  + `{group_id}` = Opaque and Immutable Okta ID for a group (e.g. _`00g1at1k0dzmV839P1d8`_)

#### Resolving Okta identifiers

When using logs from Okta to write back to Okta, the values for `user_id`, `group_id` and others will be present in the log.  They will be found in the `actor` or `target` object, along with other references suitable for distinction.

When using logs from outside of Okta to trigger to coorelate or trigger events, use the lookup and search functions described in the [Users](./security-analytics.html#users) and [Groups](./security-analytics.html#groups) sections above to retrieve the Okta identifier for those objects.
