## eventType Namespace

The log eventType property is a hierarchical string representing a consistent parent.sublevel.action structure that allows for flexible queries and human readability.

Examples of this in action

+ Using SCIM filter syntax Searching for `eventType co ".create"`
  + return creation events for all object types
+ Using SCIM filter syntax Searching for `eventType sw "user.authentication."`
  + return all activities relating to user authentication.

Similar or more powerful queries can be performed when ingesting date into external systems.

Learn more about [filtering here](../../docs/api/getting_started/design_principles.html#filtering)

## Event Stitching

Use the following to track events over time and across activities.

Throughout a session many requests can occur, and within a given request many events may be logged.

To illustrate this principle, the table below shows

+ 18 events
  + reduced to
+ 13 transactions
  + tied back to
+ 6 different sessions
  + pinned to 1 user

{% img eventStitchingConcept.png alt:"Event Stitching Concept" %}

With the log object the following mappings apply

| | Log Data Model Location | Description |
|:----|:----|:----|
| session | authenticationContext.externalSessionId| External Session identifier of the request |
| transaction | transaction.id | ID of the transaction object |
| event | uuid | Randomly Generated Unique Identifier for event |

## Event API to System Log API

Use the following table for reference when moving from the Events API to the System Log API

| Event Property | Log Property |
|:----|:----|
| `event.eventId` | `log.uuid` |
| `event.sessionId` | `log.authenticationContext.externalSessionId` |
| `event.requestId` | `log.transaction.id` |
| `event.published` | `log.published` |
| `event.action.message` | `log.displayMessage` |
| `event.action.categories[0]` | n/a, `log.severity` and `log.outcome` contain similar |
| `event.action.categories[1]` | n/a, `log.severity` and `log.outcome` contain similar |
| `event.action.objectType` | `log.legacyEventType` |
| `event.action.requestUri` | `log.debugContext.debugData.requestUri` |
| `event.actors[0].id` | `log.client.userAgent.rawUserAgent` |
| `event.actors[0].displayName` | `log.client.userAgent.browser` |
| `event.actors[0].ipAddress` | `log.client.ipAddress` |
| `event.actors[0].objectType` | `log.client.device` |
| `event.targets[0].id` | `log.actor.id` |
| `event.targets[0].displayName` | `log.actor.displayName` |
| `event.targets[0].login` | `log.actor.alternateId` |
| `event.targets[0].objectType` | `log.actor.type` |

## Other notable events

Events for failed authentication attempts and failed multifactor verification attempts are potential indicators of abuse. Additional context provided in the log will allow for pivoting this information based on things like Target User, Client IP address, Geography, User-Agent and more.

Below are truncated examples of specific logs to illustrate the log object structure and the data it contains.\\
In these examples, we will use the following semantics:

+ An Okta compatible filter that would return the example event will be included
+ An ellipsis ("...") is used to signify truncated data
+ Object properties will be referenced using Dot notation

>`authenticationContext.externalSessionId` is only populated on a successful login

From here you can easily start to pivot off the various pieces of information contained.

+ Is this an isolated event for the user (`actor.id`)?
+ Are we seeing this same client (`client.ipAddress`) fail for many users?
+ Are we seeing morphing client details (`client.*`) for a single user?

  ]
}
~~~

> A successful IdP-initiated Sign On into an app called “Workplace by Facebook”:

Note the `target[1].alternateId` is different than the `actor.alternateId`

+ Is the username in the downstream system
+ Is this privilege abuse

Pivoting and linking other logs with the same `authenticationContext.externalSessionId` can provide:

+ Context about how and when the user was initially authenticated
+ Insight into potential client roaming
+ Insight into other applications used during the same session

Over time you can paint a rich picture of user and endpoint behavior on and off your network.

### Notable and less obvious events

Some less obvious events to utilize are listed here:

+ User state changes (`eventType sw "user.lifecycle."`)
+ Group membership changes (`eventType sw "group.user_membership."`)
+ Directory agent events (`eventType sw "system.agent."`)
+ Application provisioning events (`eventType sw "application.provision."`)
+ Application username changes (`eventType eq "application.user_membership.change_username"`)
+ Password Reset events (`eventType eq "user.account.reset_password"`)
  + An eventType of
    + `system.email.password_reset.sent_message` or
    + `system.sms.send_password_reset_message`
  + Without a subsequent
    + `user.account.reset_password` for that user is an indicator of an abandoned password reset attempt and potential abuse
+ MFA lifecycle events (`eventType sw "user.mfa.factor."`)

Tracking activities like these and others can identify both operational and security risks.
