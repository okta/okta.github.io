## Integrate with Okta

With over 4000 pre-integrated applications, the [Okta Application Network (OAN)](https://www.okta.com/resources/find-your-apps/) provides a great way for ISVs to integrate with an enterprise-grade identity management solution.
The OAN takes the burden of integration away from your customers while providing a simple, standards-based methodology for your application to support federated SSO, automated provisioning, and directory integration.

By integrating with Okta, your application also benefits from other powerful features such Okta's integrations with on-premise Active Directory/LDAP infrastructure and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
You need to support either Okta Single Sign On or Provisioning in order to be part of Okta Application Network.
Okta strongly recommends that you implement both. Once you have published in the OAN, promoting your application helps drive more customers to your app.
